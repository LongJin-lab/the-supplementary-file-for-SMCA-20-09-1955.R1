This supplementary file provides the code of this manuscript: Noise-Suppressing Neural Dynamics for Time-Dependent Constrained Nonlinear Optimization
With Applications. 

[1] The file named as the application to pca corresponds to the simulation
results in Section V-A of the manuscript. 

[2] The file named as the illustrative example 
simulation of the proposed neural dynamics corresponds to the simulation 
results in Section V-B of the manuscript. 

[3] The application to robot in Section V-C includes three files. 1) The file
named as robot ur5 of the proposed neural dynamics utilizes the proposed noise-suppressing
neural dynamics (12) in the manuscript to drive the ur5 robot manipulator to conduct 
the motion planning task with disturbance. 2) The file named as robot ur5 of the dual
 neural network takes the dual neural network (29) in the manuscript as the computing 
scheme. 3) Note that the presentation of the virtual robot experimentation platform
 (V-rep) integrated development environment is in file "vrep api".
