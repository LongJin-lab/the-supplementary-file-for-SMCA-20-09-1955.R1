mpt_1, mpt_2, mpt_3, mpt_4, and mpt_5 are the main programs which provide the computing results including the joint angle, joint velocity, the position error, and the 3-D view of
robotic manipulator conducting motion planning task. The involved computing scheme is the noise-suppressing neural dynamics (12) in the manuscript. Please run them in turn.
